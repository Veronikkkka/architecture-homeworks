# Homework 6: add cache Redis

Author: Veronika

## üìù What does this MR do?

I introduced caching mechanisms to improve the performance of the application. This includes caching event details, descriptions, and reviews to reduce database queries and improve response times.To achieve this, I made alterations to several endpoints, encompassing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations for each respective table (event, reviews, description). Additionally, I introduced a new endpoint designed to consolidate all pertinent information about an event. This includes details about the event itself, its associated description, and any reviews it may have garnered.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to run and Results

With caching implemented, response times for retrieving event details, descriptions, and reviews should be significantly faster, as fewer database queries will be required.
